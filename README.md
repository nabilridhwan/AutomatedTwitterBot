# Features/Scripts/Modes
Currently, *skrurai-bot* is running the **math-evaluation script** which will evaluate math equations if the bot is mentioned on Twitter in THIS format:
`@0skrurai evaluate:<math-equation>`

Otherwise, all previous 'scripts' or 'modes' that skrurai-bot once ran are all located in `presets.py` with brief description of what they are.

# Clear/Clean all tweets and likes
Cleaning the bot's tweets and likes is as simple as 1,2,3.

    ```

    ```python
    clean(api_object, clean_statuses, clean_likes)
    ```

    -   api_object
        -   the variable with `tweepy.API(auth)`
    -   clean_statuses
        -   boolean - If true, Cleans all the statuses except statueses with (ðŸš«) in it.
